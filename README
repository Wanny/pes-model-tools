This is a modified PES exporter script for Blender to work with trophy models for PES 2017

There is also a small additional tool: modmatrix.c - it allows to tell the game how to
translate/resize the trophy for the animation scene, when the captain lifts the trophy
into the air.


CREDIT:
PES exporter script for Blender was originally written by Suat CAGDAS (sxsxsx).
It was enhanced and modified by appul, according to the information in the source code.

See detailed documentation here on how to use these Blender scripts:

My modification for PES exporter was only to fix the orientation problem with PES 2017 trophies.
I do not know if it works for other types of models, so i renamed it as "pes_trophy_exporter.py".

The modmatrix tool can be compiled with any C-compiler
On Windows: cl modmatrix.c
On Unix/Linux: gcc -o modmatrix modmatrix.c
